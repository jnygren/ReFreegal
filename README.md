# ReFreegal
Freegal downloaded file renamer.

Freegal is a free, legal music download service available through many public libraries.

The music files downloaded through Freegal are formatted like this: "LayneRedmond_TheWhirler_257608-01-004_mp3_256k.mp3". This is not how I wanted my files named.

ReFreegal parses the Freegal-created filenames and reads the ID3 tag in the files to produce a more readable name. For example: "04 The Whirler.mp3".
